# Classifying Pitches using Machine Learning
## Background
###  Trying to identify different pitches thrown by the pitchers has been one of the most popular topics not only between amatuers baseball fans but also baseball savants. The goal of this project is try to build up pitch classifying model and review the performance of different machine learning algorithm including "Random Forest", "Decison Tree", and "SVC".
## Data
### To gather the pitching data, I used the pybaseball, a python package for scraping baseball data. The pitching data I selected is all the pitches of MLB from 2022-04-01 till 2022-10-01, basically all the pitches of 2022 MLB regular season.
